This project is the first in The Odin Project curriculum. The goal was to replicate the primary visual elements of the Google homepage using html and CSS.

Main skills demonstrated are vertical and horizontal alignment of images and text, creation of top and bottom navigation bars, and a variety of stylings for links, search forms, and buttons.
